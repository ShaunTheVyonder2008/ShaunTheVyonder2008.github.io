<h1 style="text-align:center">Hello there!</h1>

<p>You landed here to my new site, in fact, with new things that is inproved from older versions!</p>

<p>Why? Simple. This is now hosted on a new platform called github! It&#39;s a known for repos, but for pages, a software for theres.</p>

<p>Also, about the new things that are now different:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Cloudflare hosting for protecting my site</li>
	<li>Namecheep domain</li>
	<li>Different html editor used</li>
	<li>Github Hosted</li>
	<li>Added repo system (incomplete)</li>
	<li>Backup server (Neocitites version)</li>
	<li>A better view and style</li>
</ol>

<p>Please note that I will be updating this site more offten, during my free time, and maybe do something else as well!</p>

<p>But for now.. This is what it looks like currently.. Kinda Different!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can look at my socials down at the bottem to know my a little better if you want..</p>

<p>Just be sure that, if I have time for this, I can have a downloads (known as a repo system) on this website, or on a different server, but with github pages.. You can deside if I should do that, depending on my time of this year!</p>
